# Empire of the Eternal Flame

The Empire spans an entire (quite large) continent. The continent and Empire homeland will not be seen in this campaign, but is a prosperous one, having just recently won a war against the other major power on this world. If needed, both lands can be seeded with cities from other D&D settings, mostly for PC backgrounds.

## The Eternal Flame

There are two deities that head the faith, the Burned One and the Voice.

**Etar, The Burned One** is what you would call an actual god, he has no real corporal form. The legend is that Etar was incinerated ages ago in a conflict with the forces of darkness. As a matter of dogma, Etar sacrificed himself for the salvation of the world. Now adherents of the Eternal Flame believe their faith and prayers will eventually heal Etar, who will return in glory once again at the hour of the world's greatest need.

**The Voice** refers to whomever is currently Empress of the Empire of the Eternal Flame. The Empress title passes to the youngest daugher of the ruling house at the time of death of the current Empress. The Empress is considered to be an avatar of The Burned One, and his voice in the mortal realm. As a mostly-mortal being, The Empress of the Eternal Flame does not have any particular powers (no divine rank, so to speak). Technically, the titles of Empress and Voice of the Burned One are two separate, and the secret histories know of at least twice in the past thousand years where they were not held by the same person. Regardless, the current Empress is also the Voice of the Burned One.

## Other Religions and Gods

The Church of the Eternal Flame is a syncretic religion; it allows for (and in fact can subsume) many other religious beliefs and deities. As the Empire expanded, it absorbed many faiths. Officially, all adherents need do is acknowledge that the Burned One is the most important god, and that all life in the mortal realm exists due to his sacrifice. Thus, worshipping Oghma or Pelor is allowed, as long as they are treated as secondary to Etar, The Burned One. Etar must come first in all prayers, and thus will he be regenerated.

In practice, the church has gone through many cycles of acceptance and oppression of these other faiths. Currently, the church is becoming less permissive; the pendulum swings towards repression as the current Empress gets older and the church heirarchy struggles for position in preparation for the investiture of the next Empress. This swing back towards conservatism is slow, but may be a reason your character has decided to move to an island that is at least six weeks of sea journey distant from the empire.

## Heirarchy

The Empire of the Eternal Flame is a pretty straightforward theocracy. The temporal leaders are also its spiritual leaders, the church bureaucracy is the same as the governmental one. Most people living in its lands are citizens, and afforded reasonable freedoms of movement, speech, and expression.

The nobility practices ultimogeniture, where titles and the bulk of the responsibility goes to the youngest child in the family, frequently the youngest daughter. Elder siblings are supported, but are also expected to make their own way in the world. This ends up leading to quite a bit of nepotism in both business and theocratic heirarchies, as parents try to clear the way for their older children who will not receive any titles upon their death.

Many non-noble families, especially merchant ones with an eye towards social climbing, make sure that their youngest is pledged to the church. 

There is universal schooling (until 10 years of age, in cities at least), and while the city guard has their share of corruption, they can usually be relied upon to keep the peace evenhandedly. Citizens in good standing have the right to support from the Church in times of need (healthcare, food, housing), although people who make too much use of those benefits may find themselves needing to just work for a diocese office.

## Species

The empire includes many Humans, Dwarves, Gnomes, and Halflings as citizens. Many other species may be citizens (such as Dragonborn, Loxodon, and Tiefling), but will be uncommon. Half-humans such as half-Elves can gain citizenship but often have to work twice as hard for half as much.

Elves are a special case: there are many Elven residents within the Empire, but no citizens. Whether this is by choice from the Elves or Empire policy is unclear, but regardless, this is the case. Elves do not worship Etar, holding their own beliefs as paramount. 

Certain other species, such as Orcs, Goblins, Kobolds, and Gnolls (the so-called monstrous races) are ruthlessly oppressed within the Empire. They are viewed as unenlightenable, and agents of the chaotic gods that The Burned One sacrificed himself to defeat.

Just which species are deemed "monstrous" has shifted over time, in part based on the ditates of the Empress (and probably informed by whomever was living on top of some resources the Empire needed).

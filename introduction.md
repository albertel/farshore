# Welcome to Farshore

## Overview

The players are members of the Farshore expedition, a large group of people sent to resettle a lost colony on a distant island. While resettling, the PCs will need to contribute to the town's reconstruction, either by directly supporting the rebuilding, or by exploring the nearby wilds in an attempt to bring critical resources to the town.

In general, the gameplay supported in this campaign includes:

* *Light town management and politics*. Convince the Mayor to do the things you want them to do, select which buildings to build first to unlock tech tree upgrades. This is still first and foremost, D&D though, not Civ, so this isn't the center of the game.
* *Overland exploration* (aka hexcrawl). Strike out into the wilds to uncover long-lost ruins, trigger random encounters, and reclaim mines and other resource sites for the town.
* *Dungeoneering*. Lots of dungeons to find for lots of ridiculous reasons. There's at least two megadungeons on the island, if you can find them.
* *A Big Dragon*. Hopefully you won't just go and frontal attack it.
* *At least some exploration of the colonialist roots of this kind of game*. As PCs, you'll be at the vanguard of a conquering force, bringing "civilization" to a region thought to be uninhabited. When you discover that there are already people here, or run into species like Goblins or Kobolds that the Empire of the Eternal Flame does not recognize as fully People, what will you do? The game supports many options here, and just running around slaying everyone might not be the best approach.
	* Don't worry though, there's still plenty of unproblematically Bad People to run around slaying.
* At least one haunted house.
* Dinosaurs.
* Mysteries, relics, a lost history of god-wars, and the lie that rots the heart of an empire.
* More dinosaurs.

## General History and Timeline
The campaign world is not necessarily any known one from the D&D cosmology. The planes may or may not exist; this is not central to the story.

About 1,000 years before present, the Empire of the Eternal Flame was founded on a large landmass. A war of conquest and religious zealotry covered the continent, converting all who dwelt there to the worship of the Eternal Flame. This theocratic empire exists to this day, and is the origin of all of the players.

About 100 years before present, the expanding empire settled Farshore, a verdant island quite distant from the main conquered landmass of the empire.

Unbeknownst to the initial settlers of Farshore (and indeed the Imperial Theocrats), the island was being nigh-simultaneously settled by the People, a loose confederacy of Dwarves, Humans, Orcs, and Elves from another, heretofore unkown continent. The first contact between the People (or People of the Tree) and the Empire was violent. Immediately, war was undertaken, for the People represented heresy in thought (they did not worship the Eternal Flame) and action (they treated Orcs, and even occasionally Goblins as equals). The war was bitter, but quite difficult, owing to the distances between the two realms. During the war, the initial settlement of Farshore was halted, and both the Empire and the People left the island and their prior works to decay.

A few years ago, there was a turning point in the war. Bold adventurers from the Emprie struck at the heart of the People of the Tree, slaying their ruling council and burning the Great Tree itself. The People, in disarray, ceded the island of Farshore. Additional concessions were granted to the Empire, and Imperial propagandists indicate that within a generation, the People of the Tree will all be converts.

## What's Upcoming

Your characters are part of an expedition to Farshore. You will be part of the colonists who resettle and reclaim the lands for the Empire. The lands themselves have been uninhabited for nearly a century, with the original port of Farshore Town on the southwest tip of the island probably falling to ruin. Two hundred folk of the empire, livestock, materiel, and trade goods will be sent to Farshore town. You will land in mid-spring, hopefully in time to plant initial crops and begin the re-settlement.

The colony will have to fend for itself, it is too far from the center of the Empire to be fully supported. Trade ships will come every six months (in the fall and spring) bringing needed supplies, and hopefully taking back goods to pay off the cost of this expedition.

## About the Colony

While the colony itself is theoretically founded to bring the Flame of Faith to new lands, in practice you will find much more grounded ambitions among the colonists. Most who travel so far are already outcasts, with little tying them to the homeland. There are outcasts, heretics (quiet, to avoid the still active theocrats), criminals, and well-intentioned adventurers seeking their fortunes in the frontier. There are probably more people in the colony seeking to get _away_ from the empire than there are trying to establish a beachhead of faith in the new land. The Empire is aware of this, seeing in Farshore a chance to ship many of its less desireable citizens off to new lands. Should Farshore Town be successful, many more people will be coming to the island.

Truly, the eyes of the Empress herself are upon Farshore, as this colony will be the model for future conquests of the now-dormant eastern continent of the Great Tree.

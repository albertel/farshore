# Hexcrawl Mechanics

A hexcrawl is an extended overland adventure in which the PCs explore a large map with many unknown elements. Generally speaking, exploring each hex takes some time and will trigger certain events.

5e has bafflingly inconsistent overland travel and exploration rules, so what follows is a mashup of many editions, plus just what works for me as a GM.

## Time
Each day is broken into 6 watch periods (4 hours each). There are three types of primary activity during a watch: Rest, Active, Travel.

* Rest: Sleeping or otherwise idle.
* Active: Exploring, fighting, doing something that engages with the terrain without moving long distances.
* Travel: Moving overland.

Spending more than 2 watches per day traveling or less than 2 resting requires a Constitution check of DC 10 + 1 for each consecutive day of this activity. Failure means the character is exhausted for the next day and must spend the day resting.

## Pace

**Normal**: An expedition traveling at normal pace cannot use Stealth checks to avoid detection, and covers 8 miles per watch.

**Slow**: While moving at a slow pace, the expedition is purposely being careful. An expedition traveling at slow pace:
- Gains advantage on navigation checks.
- Can make Stealth checks to avoid detection.
- The chance for a non-exploratory encounter is halved. (If a non-exploratory encounter is generated, there is a 50% chance it doesn’t actually happen.)
- Covers 4 miles per watch.

**Exploration**: While exploring, an expedition is assumed to be trying out side trails, examining objects of interest, and so forth. While exploring, an expedition:
- Cannot use Stealth checks to avoid detection.
- Gains advantage on navigation checks.
- The chance for encounters is doubled.
- Covers 4 miles per watch.

**Fast**: While moving quickly through the wilderness, expeditions traveling at fast pace:
- Cannot use Stealth checks to avoid detection.
- Suffer disadvantage to Wisdom (Perception) checks.
- Suffer a -5 penalty to navigation checks.
- Covers 12 miles per watch.

**Mounted Travel**: If all party members are mounted, they cannot travel at Slow pace, but cover 50% more distance per watch.

## Terrain

Different terrain types will impact your travel. The Navigation DC is the base target to move in the direction you want, instead of a random direction. Failures at navigation checks will hinder movement (you may go in circles or end up leaving the hex in a random direction).

Terrain Type  | Speed Modifier | Navigation DC | Forage DC | Encounter Distance
--------------|----------------|---------------|-----------|-------------------
Desert        |  1x            | 12            | 20        | 200'
Sparse Forest |  1x            | 14            | 14        | 100'
Medium Forest |  0.75x         | 16            | 14        | 80'
Dense Forest  |  0.5x          | 18            | 14        | 60'
Plains        |  1x            | 12            | 14        | 400'
Swamp         |  0.5x          | 16            | 12        | 200'
Mountains     |  0.5x          | 14            | 16        | 200'

Other conditions (weather, rivers, maps, etc) will further modify the speed and check DC.

## Actions

### Foraging

Characters can forage during an active watch or while traveling at a slow pace. Foragers make a Wisdom (Survival) test against the Forage DC of the terrain. On a success, the forager either gains 1 ration of food or finds a source of fresh water (allowing the expedition to drink their daily ration of water and for waterskins to be refilled). An additional ration of food or source of fresh water can be found for every 2 points by which the check result exceeds the DC.

**FOOD & WATER**

> **Food**: Small or medium creatures require 1 ration of food per day. They can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + their Constitution modifier (minimum 1) before suffering 1 exhaustion level per day thereafter. A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.
> 
> A creature on half rations counts as going a ½ day without food (and these half days accumulate until they can eat full rations).
> 
> **Water**: Small or medium creatures require 1 gallon of water per day, or twice that in hot weather. A creature on a half ration of water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution check at the end of each day or suffer a level of exhaustion. If they drink less water than that, they suffer a level of exhaustion automatically. If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.
> 
> Waterskins hold a half-ration of water.
> 
> **Recovery**: Any exhaustion suffered from lack of food or water cannot be removed until after a full day of normal consumption.
> 
> **Large & Tiny Creatures**: Tiny creatures require one-quarter ration of food and water per day. Large creatures (like horses) require four rations  of food and water per day.

### Navigating
If the party is not following a well-known trail (or tracking something, see below), they are blazing a new trail. Make a Navigation check against the modified terrain DC.

* Natural 1
* Fail by more than 5
* Fail
* Succeed
* Succeed by more than 5
* Natural 20

The party can have at most one navigator, who makes navigation checks while moving, or can make additional navigation checks during an active watch to better pinpoint their location. A secondary navigator can assist, giving advantage on these checks using the Aid Another rules.

Either the navigator or another character can also attempt to track something as the party travels. The DC for tracking over long range varies from 10 to 20, depending on the terrain, number and condition of the quarry, and weather.

### Scouting / Exploring
A scout can make a scouting check during an active watch. They should make a Survival check against the terrain's navigation DC. Success means the party can ignore up to 25% of terrain penalties in their next watch of travel, and alerts the scouting party to nearby encounters and structures. Note that a scouting party runs the risk of triggering separate encounters.

During exploring actions, it may be possible to locate a good point of view (overlook, tall tree), and use Athletics to gain a significant view of the surrounding area.

## Visibility and Encounters

The typical party visibility maxes out at 3 miles. If the party gains significant elevation, they can see further: 4 miles at 10 feet, 6 miles at 25 feet, 9 miles at 50 feet, and 12 miles at 100 feet. Weather and terrain will further limit visibility distance.

When triggering an encounter, the initial distance of the encounter is given in the above table, although that is just an average number. Actual encounters can vary.

The party will encounter a large number of different sorts of things in the wilds. They may be just wandering monsters, encounters with friendly or unfriendly sapient creatures, or ruins ready to plunder.

## General Procedure

For each watch, each player will declare what they are doing. After declarations, any relevant dice are rolled by players to determine outcome, and the GM will roll to determine random encounters.

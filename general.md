# General House Rules

## Special Mechanics
### Extended Actions

Many of the extended actions (town construction, overland navigation) in this game require a single die roll. Inspiration and other short-term bonuses (the guidance cantrip, for exmaple) cannot be used to modify these rolls. 

Each of these checks will result in the following states:

* Critical Failure: A natural 1. Failure, plus something really bad happens.
* Significant Failure: Failure by 5 or more. Outright failure, often with a minor negative consequence.
* Marginal Failure: Failure by less than 5. Sometimes the original goal is achieved, but there is an extra cost (you get where you were going, but take an extra day to get there).
* Success: Success by less than 5. You did what you wanted.
* Great Success: Success by more than 5. You really did what you wanted, with a minor benefit.
* Critical Success: Natural 20. Super awesome.

Note that in the case where the modified roll from a natural 20 is not enough to be successful (say the DC is 50), then the GM has the final say on the results of a natural 20. Similar rules apply for when a natural 1, adjusted for proficiency / abilities is not an actual failure.
